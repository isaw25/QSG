2:30 
And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know.


* introduction of another creature of Allah swt i.e, angels.
* khalifa: authority / successor
-as a successor: Man as a successor of Dhijn. (Dhijnn still exists and are not extinct, so to say.)
- as a deputy/successor of Allah. 
-as a authority:  urdu { sahibe-iqtidaar}, as if like a king. egL Dhulqarnain.
Mankind as a whole has been given this authority by Allah swt.
also used khalifa word for Hz Dawud as. 

the Angels asked, questioned humbly.
"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?"


why would Angels question-- 
angels had the authority/ on the earth?


Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know.


2:31

And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful."

-Adam who is the khalifa mentioned above, was taught all of the names.  whose names, or what could it be.
one interpretation: these names could be an introduction of Great prophets/people, or Panjatan pak.

and then He showed them to the angels,.. He introduced these great men to the Angels,..

Ibn Abbas: 
The names Adam is taught are considered by some, such as Ibn ʿAbbās, to
be those that people use in discourse with one another, such as “man,” “sea,”
“mountain,” and even “kettle.” To others, such as Mujāhid, they are “the names
of everything.” Still others say he was taught the names of angels; or that he was
taught the names of all his progeny

or All the languages of the world.
or ISME AAZAM ( the divine names.)

Thus, Adam
could know God in ways the angels could not.


2:32
They said, “Glory be to Thee! We have no knowledge save what
Thou hast taught us. Truly Thou art the Knower, the Wise.”

This verse indicates the limitation of the knowledge of God by angels as
far as the universal comprehensive nature of this knowledge is concerned.

also acceptance of Angels.

2:33
He said, “Adam, tell them their names.” And when he had told
them their names He said, “Did I not say to you that I know the
unseen of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you
disclose and what you used to conceal?”

what you used to conceal could be a reference to the pride of Iblis, or the belief
attributed to Angels that "God never creates a thing except that we are more noble than it."


2:34
And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate unto Adam,” they
prostrated, save Iblīs. He refused and waxed arrogant, and was among
the disbelievers...
